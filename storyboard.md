## **Overview**:

Brooklyn is a borough in New York City that experienced a relevant shift in industry and residential demographics over the past decade. A renaissance of small businesses primarily in the technology sector have grouped together in the Downtown Brooklyn, Dumbo, and the Navy Yard neighborhoods forming what the city now refers to as the Brooklyn Tech Triangle (BTT). The tech sector was responsible for the most leasing activity in NYC during 2012, helping the city to turn its planning efforts to what is now the BTT.

## **The transportation connection**: 

There are indicators that show BTT is just the beginning of the industryâ€™s expansion further in Brooklyn, specifically north and south along the eastern coast. In October 2014, Mayor DeBlasio unveiled a new ferry route connecting Roosevelt Island to Redhook and BTT in between.[^1] The neighborhoods of Williamsburg and Greenpoint are increasingly home to tech startups and the construction of Cornellâ€™s Roosevelt Island engineering campus directly north of Greenpoint shows that BTT will soon outgrow the current boundaries. The eastern most border of BTT is marked by the Barclays Center in Downtown which is a major public transportation hub for subway, bus, and Long Island Railroad connectivity. Additional public transportation efforts are in the works; Senator Chuck Schumer proposed in the Spring of 2013 that the NY Department of Transportation allot funding for a â€˜nerd busâ€™ between Silicon Alley in Manhattan and BTT to bridge the divide between the two tech communities.[^2]

## **Demographics**:

According to a 2013 study by the New York City Economic Development Corporation, the BTT is currently home to 523 technology firms and will double the amount of employees by the end of 2015.[^3] In addition, 74% of Manhattan-based tech companies would consider relocating to the Triangle contributing to the sustainable growth of the area.

## **Who are the people that makeup the tech-startup industry?**

- As of 2012, 9,600 people work in the tech industry within BTT.

- Of the 6,400 tech employees that work in the Navy Yard, 50% live in Brooklyn and 30% live in the same neighborhood where they work.

- Brooklyn Navy Yard is the area where most tech people live and also work.

- Downtown Brooklyn, within the Triangle, has over 50,000 college students enrolled in 12 different universities, including NYU Poly-Tech.

- Average age of tech-startup founder in NYC is 31.

## **Struggles:**

The main struggles that we face in gathering info to get 2014-2015 data from the different organizations, which we are citing: NYCDEC, Urbanomics, NYC government, etc. The information we have from these organizations is from 2012 and 2013, which in a rapidly growing environment may not paint a clear picture of the current tech ecosystem. We are also researching the finances and economics of the individual businesses; we 
would like to obtain the expenditure and investment information to know how tech startups are growing from the startup phase into established businesses.
