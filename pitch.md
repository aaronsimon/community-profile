## **Silicon Brooklyn**: 
Over the past decade Brooklyn has silently become a main destination for tech startups, both early-stage and established. 
This is growth in the tech industry contributed greatly to private sector job growth in the borough, and Manhattan is no longer the default home for tech startups.
With increasing venture capital investment already over $1 billion/year and the construction of Cornell's new engineering tech campus in the works, the footprint of Brooklyn's tech scene will continue to grow. What are the economic and structural affects?    

## **Pitch**:
Why we care: The center of the tech startup world is assumed to be in Silicon Valley, and by certain metrics the startup mecca is in California. Brooklyn tech startups however, are quickly changing that perception and are part of the total NYC tech startup scene that is becoming more visible and changing the landscape of the city: In 2013, 45,000 jobs were created in the NYC tech industry, compared to 40,000 in Silicon Valley.   
NYC's tech startup boom came to fruition approximately 20 years ago and has since scaled considerably. With the creation of the Brooklyn Tech Triangle, enormous private sector job growth from tech entrepreneurship, and the construction of Cornell's new engineering campus on Roosevelt Island in the East River, even more businesses are to be founded and the tech landscape continues to grow. What does this mean for Brooklyn's economy? Who are the founders of these startup companies? Will the growth continue sustainably?   
Who cares: The Brookyln tech trend seems to be long term and not only a passing characteristics of the cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s current and future economic growth. Tech startups create new jobs with higher than average salaries and bring in new residents from across the country and world. Increasingly this is changing the makeup of Brooklyn; how does the city respond to a changing and growing demographic of affluent tech workers that need housing, high speed broad band internet, transportation connectivity, and venture capital opportunities to incubate their small businesses.

What does the expansion of a tech-based economy mean for the greater population at large in terms of property value, rental prices, salary, and cost of living? How can the city serve a new tech campus on Rossevelt Island that is now being built? Who will found and work at these new businesses?  
Pre-reporting: 
By gathering data sets and maps we began to gain a clear picture of the tech startup ecosystem in New York City and Brooklyn specifically. While the growth over the past decade for tech startups is massive, there are many common and measurable statistics surrounding the industry: Geographic location, venture capital investment, real estate value and leasing trends, high speed broadband Internet availability, job sector growth, economic impact, and transportation availability are all topics related to the tech industry. 
We are reaching out to Brooklyn tech startups to gain even more data and insight into the developments of the tech community to learn from the recent past and paint a clear picture of the future.

Many in state investment initiatives help to contribute venture capital funding for early-stage startup businesses in NYC. 

During the vital early stages of growth, small startups desperately need capital to scale up. NYC can be a nurturing location for these delicate small businesses. In 2013 alone $1.3 billion was invested in NYC tech startups. As tech companies grow they also create jobs. The jobs that are created by tech startups come with a much higher average compensation than jobs in other industries.

The significance of the employment statistics from the NYC tech industry is that tech companies grew during the recent economic recession:

Over the past 10 years, the New York City tech ecosystem grew by 45,000 jobs (18%), outpacing New York City's 12% employment growth and the Nation's 4% growth over the same time period. Although there was a slight decline in size from 2008 to 2009 due to the recession, from 2010 to 2013, the tech ecosystem grew by 11% (compared to 6% growth of the overall New York City workforce).


Job growth from tech startups is now a significant contributor to the overall employment of NYC residents.

“The NYC tech ecosystem generates approximately 541,000 total jobs, which comprises 12.6% of total NYC employment."

[Economic Impacts of the Brooklyn Tech Triangle](http://brooklyntechtriangle.com/assets/Brooklyn-Tech-Triangle-Economic-Impact.pdf) 

The report is a comprehensive economic analysis of the Brooklyn Tech Triangle (BTT) and finds that the region draws startups from all over the city and the country alike:

“56.8% of responding firms originated in Brooklyn; 30.4% of firms were born in other NYC locations; 12.8% of surveyed firms have moved to Brooklyn from elsewhere in the US and abroad."

The greater economic implications of the BTT region reveal job growth and the expansion of real estate for tech startup offices: 

“Economic Impact of Tech Triangle Firms in 2012: 

9,628 Direct Jobs, 1.7 million sq. feet of office space, 23,000 additional jobs supported, and $3.1 billion total local economic impact. 

[Broadband Mapping Project](http://www.broadbandmap.ny.gov/content/in-depth.html#getData)

With data from broadband providers, the Broadband Mapping Unit of the NYS Office of Information Technology Services provides this as a GIS data set to show high speed broadband availability and throughout NYC census tracts. This data can help to map the demand for broadband from tech startups and to visualize how and where the expansion of fiber optic Internet is expected.    
 

[Digital NYC Startup Map](http://www.scribd.com/doc/254625039/Proposed-NYC-Ferry-Expansion-Map)
This is a simple open map in which shows the geographic location of NYC startups; this is a helpful tool to visualize the location of tech startups in comparison to Brooklyn and Manhattan. Fields to filter include startups, investors, workspaces and incubators. These data fields help to see where early stage startups are now forming, also the location where more established startups end up being located.

[NYC Proposed Ferry Expansion Map](http://www.scribd.com/doc/254625039/Proposed-NYC-Ferry-Expansion-Map)

Mayor Bill DeBlasio proposed an expansion of waterway travel with plans to increase ferry service between many coastal regions on the East River in Brooklyn, and to connect service to Roosevelt Island where the new Cornel engineering will be operating within the next 5 years. The map is a clear example of how the city is responding to the needs of a growing demographic of commuters that live along the Brooklyn coast who may not have efficient access to subway and bus lines. 

[New York City Industrial Business Zones](http://www.nycedc.com/industry/industrial/nyc-industrial-business-zones)

The NYC industrial business zones are established to reserve space for industrial growth in NYC. The regions of N. Brooklyn and the Brooklyn Navy Yard, part of the Tech Triangle, are home to a growing number of tech startups. How does the zoning for industrial space correlate with where startups are headquartered? Does industrial zoning create a conducive real estate market for affordable housing?
