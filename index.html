	    <h1>Tech Boom Doesn't Raise Average Wage in Brooklyn </h1>
	    <p class="lead">Brooklyn is the poorest of all NYC boroughs despite significant growth in high compensation tech jobs.</p>
	  </div><!-- /jumbotron --> Brooklyn has the 2nd highest number of tech jobs, yet has lowest average wage in NYC.</p>

<p>New York City tech startups attracted a record <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/02/06/new-york-citys-tech-boom-continues/">$5 billion in venture capital investment in 2014</a>. The growth in investment has helped <a ref="https://www.cbinsights.com/blog/new-york-tech-investment-report/">early, mid, and late stage</a> tech startups raise capital to hire more employees and expand. This should be welcomed news for New Yorkers as tech industry wages are higher than average, and <a ref="http://www.us.jll.com/united-states/en-us/Research/US-high-tech-July-2014.pdf">tech salaries increased 11.3 percent</a> 2012-2013 in Manhattan and Brooklyn.</p>
<p>According to an independent study by <a ref="http://www.hraadvisors.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/NYC_Tech_Ecosystem_032614_WEB.pdf/">HR&A Advisors</a>, NYC workers of all education backgrounds benefit: "Jobs in the NYC tech ecosystem that do not require Bachelor's degrees pay 45% higher hourly wages than jobs with the same educational requirements". The study also cites that the tech ecosystem generated 291,000 jobs directly in 2013. To see how the tech boom is affecting the total NYC population, itâ€™s worth analyzing average wages by borough to see if average wages are high in the areas that are home to the most tech businesses.</p>

<p>Manhattan is home to the highest amount of tech businesses followed by Brooklyn, which as of 2013 hosts 10% of the city's tech businesses. The neighborhoods of DUMBO, Downtown, and the Navy Yard in Brooklyn have such a high concentration of tech startups, the area is now referred to as <a ref="http://brooklyntechtriangle.com/">the Brooklyn Tech Triangle</a>.</p>

<div class="col-md-12">
<p>When looking at average wages by borough, Manhattan is the highest and Brooklyn is the lowest.</p>

<div class="col-md-12">
<p>The tech industry employed the exact same amount of workers in Brooklyn and Queens in 2014: 26,190.</p>
<p><a href="http://imgur.com/SPzI1x8"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/SPzI1x8.png?1" title="source: imgur.com" /></a></p>
<p>Both workers in Queens and Staten Island, areas that are associated with the middle class, have higher average weekly wages than Brooklyn. How come tech salaries have not boosted the average worker's wages in Brooklyn?</p>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-12"> 
	    <p>With lagging average weekly salaries, it's clear that the greater Brooklyn population has not benefited from the tech boom.</p>
