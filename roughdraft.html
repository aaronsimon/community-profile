<p>Public and private organizations argue that the New York tech industry is booming, offering generous wages and salaries. According to the state comptroller's office, the total wages paid by firms in the city's high-tech industry rose by 38 percent since 2009, reaching $11.4 billion in 2012, the highest level on record. This represented 3.8 percent of all wages paid in New York City during 2012.</p>

<p>A study by <a href="http://www.launch.org/">Launch</a>, a public-private organization, reveals that the tech boom is concentrated in lower Manhattan within five tech hotspots, followed by Brooklyn with three hotspots. Brooklyn is home to more than 500 high tech companies located in the North East part of the borough, also known as the Brooklyn Tech Triangle.   
<p>However, according to the bureau of labor statistics, the average weekly wage in Brooklyn remains the lowest of the five boroughs of New York, as we can see on the chart bellow.</p>

	    <p>According to the labor of statistic, the average weekly wage for high tech occupation in the metropolitan area is significantly high as we can see on the chart bellow.

	    <p>Tech occupations exist within all fields. With the available data it's difficult to separate the tech-related jobs from their umbrella industries to determine how much tech-related jobs are truly affecting average weekly wages in Kings County.</p>
